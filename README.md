Trying to connect docker on `fikus` Linux pc to `TIM_PC` Windows PC. 

`docker_ros2_humble.yml` is later file. first doker file was `docker-compose.yml` (deleted it).

Try and figure out how to `git push` everything including `ros2_ws` to Windows PC. 

## Docker workspace organization: 
Added ros2_ws to "/workspace/ros2_ws" to `ros2_humble_docker.yml`
